# Seam Carver

> [!WARNING]
> This repository needs cleaning up. The code and user experience need urgent improvement.

Seam carver is an outrageously cool algorithm used to resize images. It's designed such that when an image is resized, it removes as little information as possible such that whole rows of pixels can be removed without it being visible.

## Quick start

```
make seam
./main
```

## Please note

The idea and code are both heavily inspired by [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding/seam-carving)

This project has not been tested on Windows or Mac, only Ubuntu linux. As far as support goes, you may always send a pull request or add an issue to this repository.
